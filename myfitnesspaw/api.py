myfitnesspaw.api

This module defines the public API for the MyFitnessPaw project.

MyFitnessPaw consists of three separate instances of Prefect flows: the ETL flow is
responsible for the fetching, transforming, and loading of myfitnesspal data for the
respective user provided; the report flows compose and send email reports to the user;
and the backup flow is responsible for maintaining the project backups.

For each of the flows MyFitnessPaw exposes a number of functons for convenient usage:
  - the `run` function will immediately execute the flow in the current python process.
  - the `register` functions will register the flow against the Prefect Cloud account
    defined in the configuration.
